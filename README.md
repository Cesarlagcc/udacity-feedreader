# Udacity Feed Reader Test
##### What's it about?
---
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## To have access to the project, you can choose either of the suggested methods.
- ##### Download or clone the repo onto your machine.
    - Once the zip file is on your computer, double click to unzip it.
    - Double click on the **index.html** file to view the test site.
